## Overview

This repository contains analog circuit designs simulated and analyzed using **LTspice**.  
The focus is on understanding **core analog concepts**, circuit behavior, and practical design implementation.

Each project folder includes:
- LTspice schematic files (`.asc`)
- Circuit diagrams
- Simulation results
- Brief documentation

## Circuits Included

### 1. DC–DC Charge Pump
A capacitor–diode based DC–DC converter used to increase the input DC voltage level using a clock-driven charge transfer mechanism.

**Concepts covered:**
- Charge transfer
- Voltage boosting
- Ripple behavior under load

---

### 2. Wien Bridge Oscillator
A low-distortion sine wave oscillator using a frequency-selective RC feedback network and an operational amplifier.

**Concepts covered:**
- Oscillation conditions
- Frequency determination
- Positive and negative feedback

---

### 3. Schmitt Trigger
A comparator circuit with positive feedback that converts noisy analog inputs into clean digital-level outputs.

**Concepts covered:**
- Hysteresis
- Threshold voltage calculation
- Noise immunity
